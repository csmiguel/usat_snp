Camacho-Sanchez, M., Velo-Antón, G., Hanson, J. O., Veríssimo, A., Martínez‐Solano, Í., Marques, A., … Carvalho, S. (2020). Comparative assessment of range-wide patterns of genetic diversity and structure with SNPs and microsatellites: a case study with Iberian amphibians.

We provide a comprehensive assessment on the patterns of genetic structure and diversity from using comparable sampling and analysis from microsatellites and SNPs.

Code for analysis and figures is available in [`code`](code/).
Raw data with DarTseq genotypes and sample metadata is available in [`data/raw`](data/raw/).
Filtered genotypes used in analysis are available in the form of [genind](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btn129) objects [here](data/intermediate/gen_consolidated_filtered.rds).

Intermediate results from scripts are stored in `data/intermediate`. Final outputs and figures are saved in `data/final`.

The version of R packages used can be found [here](code/r-packages-versions.txt).
